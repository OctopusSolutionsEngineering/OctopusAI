This is an experimental Chrome extension that adds the ability to perform AI based queries on a cloud Octopus instance.

Click the extension icon while a cloud Octopus instance is open to see the query interface.

To use the extension, load it as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked). You can also install it from the 
[Chrome store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/octopus-ai-experiment/lpeediihgpakkfdiliphohbglloghlmi).
